SPIRLe > Device
======

All kinds of goodies in varying stages of completion.

The role of the device code
---------------------------
- listen for messages from host (by serial connection or socket)
- receive and process messages
- act on messages
- send response based on the results of action on the device


The implementations
-------------------
- Arduino - canonical implementation. almost complete.
- Contiki - extremely early draft, playing around mostly.
- Gadgeteer - abandoned but still not far off completion.
- Generic (Native) - the song that remains the same almost regardless of platform.
- RaspberryPi - like Contiki, a play around.
